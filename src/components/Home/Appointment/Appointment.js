                        <p>An appointment is a scheduled meeting, typically in healthcare, where a patient sets a specific time to see a medical professional for consultation, treatment, or other services. It's a crucial system for organized and personalized healthcare delivery, reducing wait times, and enhancing patient care. Appointments
                            can be made by contacting the healthcare provider's office or through online scheduling systems.  </p>
